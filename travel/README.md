## Introduction
This is a code repository for our web technology project for 2021. It is a full-stack project built using the MERN stack.

- [x] MongoDB
- [x] Express
- [x] React
- [x] Node


The main aim of the project was to create a blogging site for users so that they could easily upload their information, articles and blogs related to their travel experiences in India. The site is simple and user-friendly and enables users to write about tourist attractions in various cities and states of India. 

A user can read all blog posts on the home page of the site. If he/she wishes to write a post or like someone elseâ€™s post, they must create their own account first. After that, he can sign in anytime he/she wants and continue writing articles. There is no limit to the number of articles that a person can write. There is no limit to the size of the article. The site is also responsive in design, which enables easy reading of the articles on mobile and other sized devices as well.
